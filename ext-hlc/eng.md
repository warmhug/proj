It's been quite a journey this year, full of surprises and unexpected events. Let's leave the past behind and move on.

next time you get a gift that is less than perfect, remember that it is not nice to look a gift horse in the mouth. After all, it’s the thought that counts. This means that it’s the thought of gift-giving and not the gift itself that is important.

" Fool around" also means light-hearted sexual activity. For example, the husband and wife were fooling around in the kitchen when their friends and family walked in for dinner. Awkward!
Finally, we often use the word " fool" in warnings to others. For example, "Don't fool around with that! You will break it." Or, " Stop fooling around." And the ever popular, " This is no time to fool around" .

Your eyes water, your heart rate goes up and your face gets that beautiful laughter glow. In fact, many doctors say that mental health can affect physical health. You might even say, "Laughter is the best medicine".
You know what we say -- misery loves company. This means that some people who are miserable and unhappy like to make others miserable and unhappy, too. On the other hand, making others laugh with you is an act of joy and kindness.
So, in the end, you could say the teacher definitely had the last laugh. When you have the last laugh, you end up winning when at first you were losing. Another way to have the last laugh, is to simply laugh off a tough situation. It shows you just do not care. For example, if the teacher is a friend of yours, you could always tell him to just laugh it off.
It may be difficult. But if you have the choice to laugh or cry, chose laughter.
As we also like to say: Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry and you cry alone. This means that people prefer to be around those who are happy and cheerful.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox, a poet of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, penned this famous expression. In her poem "Solitude," she writes ,"Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone".

Broadway's Theater District is between 42nd and 53rd Streets in downtown Manhattan.

The first ones are about love. Some people say, "All is fair in love and war". They mean that anything you do in a relationship or in battle is acceptable. Another proverb about love is, "Absence makes the heart grow fonder". This means you love someone even more when he or she is far away. But other people say, "Out of sight, out of mind". You may not even think about that person when he or she is not with you. Which of these proverbs do you think is most true? Another proverb says "Love is blind". In other words, when you are in love with someone, you may refuse to see anything bad about that person. Here is another popular saying about love: "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach". Some people believe that a woman can win a man's love if she prepares his favorite foods.

as easy as taking candy from a baby.

Why didn't you say something sooner"?

If your apple didn't fall far from the tree, you are very much like your mom or dad. And if you are compare apples and oranges you are comparing two things that are so different that any comparison is really not productive.

What is a whistleblower? The word sounds like it means a person directing a game, or a police officer directing traffic. Those people often has a device called a whistle, which makes a loud sound when you blow air through it. The sound of the whistle is usually a sign that someone has violated a rule.

Trust usually comes with time.

It is easy to get the two terms mixed up. They both deal with distance.
"Farther" can also be used as an adverb, like in the following example, well known to parents taking a trip with young children. Mommy! Are we there yet? How much farther do we have to go until we get there?!

"Hi, Dave"! you say. "Good to see you again. What's going on"? Dave may say: "Maggie! I have been so busy at work. All is well. What's up with you"? Dave wants to know what Maggie has been doing recently. This is a wide open, general question.
You see your friend Mary at the bus stop. You know her mother was sick and in the hospital. "Hi, Mary. I have been thinking about you. How is it going? How is your Mom doing"?

Here is another version is by the Scottish group The Cast.

Another expression usually used for business and not parties is A-S-A-P. So, a colleague might say she needs something done ASAP. It means as soon as possible. She might also need to have something done by C-O-B. That means she wants to finish it by "Close Of Business" or the end of the work day.

Let's say you forgot that you invited your boyfriend or girlfriend to a special birthday date. Your beloved waited for you, for hours, crying, in the rain. Much later, you sit up in bed and remember your missed appointment. You immediately call your partner and say that you are so sorry. You promise to wear sackcloth and ashes for the rest of the month.
You can also use the phrase "sackcloth and ashes" in a sarcastic way. This means you say it, but do not really mean it.

When a country experiences a recession or depression, people who live paycheck-to-paycheck may find themselves in a tough situation. Living paycheck-to-paycheck means you have little money in savings. You need your next paycheck to pay your bills. However, if you have some money put aside, you might feel less stressed.

Another way we use "demand" these days is in talking about the "on-demand economy". That is the term used for internet-based businesses such as ride-sharing, meal delivery and online shopping which connect purchasers immediately and directly with goods and services. When you "demand" an Uber or Lyft car, it comes to you.

Maybe instead of sending a text message with the letters BRB (be right back),we could use the image of a lamb shaking its tail. That would fun!

She must have realized how surprised I was. So, she apologized for springing her happy news on me out of the blue like that.
But what if the news involves other people? That is when springing it on someone is a bit more complex.
They had been building their company for a few years and were finally starting to make a profit.

Maybe the person has many mouths to feed at home and does not have time to stop and smell the roses. People and their situations are complex.

People who do not want to hear our ideas, tell us not to "waste our breath".If we are really unhappy with someone, we can say to them, "You are a waste of space"!
If someone is very sick or is losing a lot of weight, we can say they are "wasting away".
And if someone has too much alcohol and cannot control their words and actions, we can say they are "wasted".
Here's the first one: "Haste makes waste".
So, if someone says, "Hurry up! It's taking you forever to cut that wood for the house project". You can simply say: "Haste makes waste. I want to do it right the first time"!
The other common expression is: "Waste not, want not". This means that if a person never wastes things, he or she will have what is needed. We often say this as a response to being very frugal.

I have taught in many countries where the common practice is for students to call me Teacher. It always sounded a little strange to me. Most Americans do not use Teacher to address a teacher in English.

Most office workers spend the day in a sitting position.

Losing his job, apartment, and wife in one month pushed my friend off the deep end. Not surprisingly!

My co-worker Pete is known for his sunny personality. Anyone who meets him likes him. He has a really sunny disposition and is always smiling. Pete always seems in a good mood.
What a happy guy.
Now, just so you know … this comment probably would make her even LESS happy! Sarcasm can easily make people angry.
People who see the good in nearly every situation are optimistic. They are hopeful. They see the glass as half full, not half empty.
The next time you run into a bump in the road -- which is another way to say a little problem -- try your best to see the sunny side.

The U.S. military is one place where following orders is very important. Soldiers called someone a "Big Wheel" if that person had power over them.

No way ! It's easier to do it by myself. I'm getting everything done that I can't do with other people around. Good idea. Make hay while the sun shines.
And sometimes we use this expression to mean we beat someone to the punch, or we got ahead of someone else.
My taxes are done. I was off from work a couple of weeks ago and made hay while the sun shined. I got all of it done!

He feels glad about how things turned out. She looks happy with her coat.

For example, people who have stage fright often look like a deer in headlights.
Let's say I am acting in a play. I know all my lines and feel ready.
So the next time you are really surprised or scared, you may find yourself looking frozen and wide-eyed -- like a deer in headlights.

Now, just like in the race, with a big project you need to pace yourself. If you start to quickly and do too much, you may run out of energy.
If you have a sprinter's mentality, you attack a problem with short, fast bursts of energy. There is no need to pace yourself. There isn't time! A sprinter's mentality means you do not hold back.
Now, a person can have both a mentality of a marathon runner and a sprinter. It may depend on the situation or project. However, some people may be more of one kind of person than the other.

Don't they know it's the end of the world? It ended when you said goodbye.

It's like he has dropped off the face of the Earth!
So, forever and a day is even longer! And it has been forever and a day since you have seen your friend.

Any kind of fire – from a campfire to a lit match – gives off smoke.
If the word on the street is that something is really bad, it just might be.
Well, he's been married before. So. There's no crime against having a marriage that didn't work out. Right. But he's been married four times.
My cousin knows a former wife of his. She says the guy owes money all over town. This is all just gossip.

Some friends are especially sympathetic and easy to talk to. They are not judgmental or impatient. They are good at sharing our pain, which helps ease our pain. A friend like this is often called "a shoulder to cry on". We can go to this person with a problem or sadness and they provide comfort.Alyssa is such a great shoulder to cry on.

The play is not likely to be successful but is made in desperation.
Apparently, the football huddle began at Gallaudet University, a university for students who have hearing disabilities.

Lessons from history can be important. In fact, we have a saying: "those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it".
It might say everyone is making a big deal out of nothing.
But even if you are hard-working and gifted, you may also need something else to succeed on Broadway – luck!

How's the new job going?
Great! I go into the office an hour early every day and stay late almost every night.
Plus, I get all my work done days ahead of my deadlines.
Aren't you worried that you might be raising the bar a bit too high? No way! If other people can't perform as well, that's good for me, right?
Well, you don't want to raise the bar SO high that one day YOU have trouble getting over it.
You know, that's a really good point. I never thought of it like that.
That's what friends are for.
Maybe I'll ease up a little bit...
Good idea.

Sometimes in life, we are pushed to our limit.
2023-11-23 记录 精听VOA的第一百天！


The last straw is the last thing that pushes you to some sort of limit.
In life, things can get tough. Sometimes, it is good not to let things bother us.
Letting things roll off our backs is a good life skill. When things roll off our backs, they are out of our minds.
They no longer bother us. But, let's face it... sometimes, things do bother us.
Sometimes in life, we are pushed to our limit. So, on today's program, we talk about those times when we have had enough!
在生活中，事情可能会变得艰难。有时候，不让事情困扰我们是件好事。
让事情从我们背上滚下来是一项很好的生活技能。当事情从我们的背上滚下来时，它们就会从我们的头脑中消失。他们不再打扰我们。
但是，让我们面对现实吧……有时候，事情确实会困扰我们。有时在生活中，我们被推到了极限。
所以，在今天的节目中，我们谈论那些我们已经受够了的时光！

We have a couple of expressions that help us describe that state of mind. They involve the word straw.
First, let's define straw. Straw is the dry stem of plants like wheat or other grains.
"Straw is yellow or golden colored and is a byproduct of the grain harvest." In other words, it is a waste product of
wheat. But it has many uses.
In a garden, you can use straw on top of soil to keep it from drying out. Straw can also keep weeds from growing.
Straw, especially dry straw, is not very nutritious. But because it is hollow, straw makes excellent bedding for animals.
Horses, cows, goats, and camels may enjoy a good night's sleep on a straw bed.
Animals not only sleep on straw. Some may also have to carry bales of straw on their backs.
And that brings us to this expression: the straw that broke the camel's back.
Merriam-Webster dictionary says the expression means "the last in a series of bad things that happen to make someone very upset, angry,..." or some other bad feeling.
The straw that broke the camel's back was one straw too many. With that piece added to the camel's back, the load became too heavy to bear.
In other words, it is the last thing to happen that makes you give up on something.
我们有几个短语可以帮助我们描述这种心态。它们涉及到straw（稻草）这个词。
首先，让我们看看straw的定义。稻草是小麦或其他谷物等植物的干茎。
“稻草是黄色或金色的，是谷物收获的副产品。”换句话说，它是小麦的废品。但它有很多用途。
在花园里，你可以用稻草覆盖在土壤上，防止土壤变干。稻草还可以防止杂草生长。
稻草，尤其是干稻草，没什么营养。但由于它是中空的，稻草是动物的绝佳被褥。马、牛、山羊和骆驼可以在稻草床上睡个好觉。
动物不仅睡在稻草上。有些可能还得背上成捆的稻草。
这就给我们带来了这样一个短语（压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草）。
韦氏词典说，这个短语的意思是“一系列让人非常不安、愤怒…….的坏事中的最后一件”，或者其他一些不好的感觉。
压垮骆驼的稻草实在是太多了。把稻草放在骆驼背上，担子变得太重了。换句话说，这是导致你放弃的最后一件事情。

Here is an example: Let's say I have a friend who constantly lets me down.
When he says he is going to do something, he never does it.
And he always promises next time will be different.
这里有一个例子：假设我有一个朋友，他总是让我失望。当他说他要做某事时，他从来没有做过。他总是承诺下一次会有所不同。

Well, one day I told him I was going out of town for two days and needed someone to feed my cat.
He offered to help. I was not so sure. But he promised that he would take care of my cat Meepers.
I believed him and left my cat in his care. Well, guess what? He forgot to feed her!
She went two whole days without food! Luckily, Meepers is a very fat cat.
嗯，有一天我告诉他我要出城两天，需要有人来喂我的猫。他主动提出要帮忙。我不是很确定。但他承诺他会照顾我的猫咪梅普尔斯。
我相信了他的话，把我的猫交给了他照顾。好吧，你猜怎么了？他忘了喂她！她整整两天没吃东西！幸运的是，梅普尔斯是一只非常胖的猫。

It was really sweet of you to ask.
how's it going.
Jin-, Daddy and I wasn't arguing about money. when I first met your daddy, he had a lot of big ideas, big hopes.And his deep voice.
You asked me once what happened to the guy you married. But what happened to the girl I married? The girl who loved singing. The girl who laughed at the top of her lungs. The girl who was so bold she came here with nothing...
I see a sad, lonely little bull, actually. I see someone who's obsessed with what other people think about him.
Honestly, I see a guy who doesn't really like himself that much. I see someone who doesn't want to show the world who he is because he's afraid that if other people saw who he really was, they'd just laugh at him. Or worse, they just wouldn't care. And that makes him sad. it makes him hurt people that he really cares about. And the worst part is, he doesn't know why he feels that way. But maybe it's not too late. Maybe he could just drop the act. Maybe he could just go back to Heaven right now and make things right before anyone else gets hurt.
I'm still just, like, a weak, dumb, whiny, little cow baby, and everyone knows it. and every single one of them is cooler, smarter, and better-looking than I am. I try to cover up all these, like, unresolved insecurities with this stupid-looking leather jacket and this dumb nose ring from the 1990s.
You have to be brave, Jin. What if I'm not though? Do you know who you are? You are worlds clashing into each other. You are all the pieces merging into one. You're everything we ever hoped for. I wish you knew how much strength you have inside you. You just have to unlock it. Just be you, Jin.
So, you remember at the beginning of the year when you asked me to hang out, and I said we could be buds?
I feel like we've hung out a lot since then, and you know, gotten to know each other better.. and we were lab partners, and you came to my house. I keep trying to find the right words to, like... draw you out and to get to the real you, and I-- Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're kind of the only person that I can really be myself around, and I wanna hang out with you more. Not as buds.

把生活体验写成英文作文，或做口头发表。 随时用英文思考，用英文记录。
特别注意英文没有的发音。 从听读过渡到说写。
先听个三个月的走遍美国。 反复的听一个单一文件，一个单课的音频，我建议你听个至少听个几十遍。
练习口语对口语没有帮助，听多了自然会说。听得少却一直说，口语很可能一直保持自己最初的水平。
背单词。要想记得一个英语单词，一定是在一个语境中，在一个句子中你才能记得的。
学习短语而不是单词。不断的扩充同义词或者短语。 把被动词汇转变为主动词汇。

学习语法 理解语法 忘掉语法。
中国学生，也是苦不堪言，最想被取消的学科。背的单词就像小熊掰玉米。
学的是假英语，而且，自己以为学得很好，说出来，中国人和外国人都听不懂。
